# NSP15 Target Notes

The `target/NSP15.tgz` file contains the target structure
prepared for autodock along with source code on its preparation
method.  The `target/6wlc.tgz` contains identical files as
`target/NSP15.tgz` with different names.  The renamed
files were used for docking.


This structure of NSP15 was chosen because it is a
transition state analogue in complex with
a pentavalent phosphate.  It should be compared to structures
7K1L, 8W01, and 6WLC, which contain uridine monophosphate..

Note relevance of Tyr 343 on NSP15.
